== Getting started

To complete this workshop, you should have installed locally:

* JDK 7 or 8.
* Git.
* Gradle 2.9+.
* Grails 3.1.6.

Also, although not mandatory, it's highly recommended to use https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ IDEA], arguably
the best IDE for Groovy and Grails development. You can just use the Community Edition if you want to.

To get started, clone the workshop repo locally:

----
git clone https://github.com/alvarosanchez/grails-angularjs-springsecurity-workshop.git
----

The workshop is organised through a set of exercises that are described below, each of one on its own directory. Each
exercise is self-explanatory. To highlight actions you actually need to perform, an icon is used: icon:hand-o-right[]

:numbered:

== Creating a Grails REST API (50 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `ex01` folder to start working on this exercise. The final solution is provided to you in the
`ex01/solution` folder.

The first exercise in this workshop is to create a Grails application that will contain a REST API. The application
will be a todo app.

=== Understanding profiles (5 minutes)

Historically, the `create-app` and `create-plugin` Grails commands have always created Grails applications and plugins
with the same structure and files. However, Grails 3 introduced profiles, that bring more options at creation time to
start with different types of applications and plugins.

A profile defines:

* The project's `build.gradle`: dependencies, plugins installed, etc.
* Additional commands for the CLI, such as `create-domain-class` or `run-app`.
* Skeleton: the initial set of files and directories of the application that will be created.
* Features: configuration subsets to bring specific behaviour. For instance, the `json-views` feature brings some
  dependencies to the `build.gradle` file, defines some commands, etc.

icon:hand-o-right[] To find out what profiles are available, use the `list-profiles` command:

----
$ grails list-profiles
| Available Profiles
--------------------
* angular - A profile for creating applications using AngularJS
* rest-api - Profile for REST API applications
* base - The base profile extended by other profiles
* plugin - Profile for plugins designed to work across all profiles
* web - Profile for Web applications
* web-plugin - Profile for Plugins designed for Web applications
----

icon:hand-o-right[] For more information on a particular profile use the `profile-info` command:

----
$ grails profile-info rest-api
Profile: rest-api
--------------------
Profile for REST API applications

Provided Commands:
--------------------
* create-controller - Creates a controller
* create-domain-resource - Creates a domain class that represents a resource
* create-functional-test - Creates an functional test
* create-integration-test - Creates an integration test
* create-interceptor - Creates an interceptor
* create-restful-controller - Creates a REST controller
...
----

WARNING: `list-profiles` and `profile-info` will only work outside of a Grails application folder.

=== Creating a project using the `rest-api` profile (15 minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] Although we will use the `angular` profile in future exercises, for the purpose of this one we will start with the
`rest-api` profile. We will also pick the `hibernate` and `json-views` features:

----
$ grails create-app -profile rest-api -features hibernate,json-views todo
| Application created at /tmp/todo
----

The next step is to create a domain class. In this case, not only we want a domain class, but also a REST controller
on top of it.

icon:hand-o-right[] There are several ways to create a RESTful controller. The easiest way it's to create a domain resource:

----
$ grails create-domain-resource todo
| Created grails-app/domain/todo/Todo.groovy
| Created src/test/groovy/todo/TodoSpec.groovy
----

This will create a domain class like this:

[source,groovy]
.Todo.groovy
----
package todo

import grails.rest.*

@Resource(readOnly = false, formats = ['json', 'xml'])
class Todo {

}
----

Notice the `@Resource` annotation: it's an AST transformation that will generate at compile time a REST controller for
the domain it's annotated to. The generated controller will have the usual CRUD methods:

* Create: `save()`.
* Read: `index()` for all elements, and `show()` for a single one.
* Update: `update()`.
* Delete: `delete()`.

In addition to that, if we define the annotation parameter `uri`, those operations will also be mapped to the
corresponding HTTP methods: `POST` for `create()`, `DELETE` for `delete()`, etc.

icon:hand-o-right[] Add the following fields to the domain class:

[source,groovy]
----
String description
boolean done
----

This is how the domain class should finally look like:

[source,groovy]
----
package todo

import grails.rest.*

@Resource(uri = '/todos', readOnly = false, formats = ['json', 'xml'])
class Todo {
    String description
    boolean done
}
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Before continuing, add some initial data in `grails-app/init/BootStrap.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
----
import todo.Todo

class BootStrap {

    def init = { servletContext ->
        5.times { new Todo(description: "Todo ${it+1}").save() }
    }
    def destroy = {
    }
}
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Next, run the application with `grails run-app`. Once it's running, you should be able to test some endpoints using `curl`:

* List existing todos: `curl -i 0:8080/todos`
* Create a new todo: `curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"description":"created from curl"}' 0:8080/todos`
* Modify the created todo: `curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"description":"modified from curl"}' -X PUT 0:8080/todos/6`
* Display the modified todo: `curl -i 0:8080/todos/6`
* And delete it: `curl -i -X DELETE 0:8080/todos/6`

=== Writing a custom RESTful controller (15 minutes)

While a domain resource may be enough for the most simplest cases, usually you will need additional actions in your
controller. So let's get rid of the `@Resource` annotation and write our own controller.

icon:hand-o-right[] Create a blank RESTful controller by running:

----
$ grails create-restful-controller todo.Todo
| Created grails-app/controllers/todo/TodoController.groovy
----

This will create a controller that `extends RestfulController`. `grails.rest.RestfulController` is the base class that
provides the CRUD methods like `index()`, `save()`, etc.

Note that those methods may be overriden if you need to. `RestfulController` also provides some other `protected` methods
that can as well be overriden to further customise its behaviour. Check
http://docs.grails.org/3.1.6/api/grails/rest/Resource.html[its documentation] for more information.

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, define a mapping for this controller in `grails-app/controllers/UrlMappings.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
----
"/todos"(resources:"todo")
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Run the application now, and test the CRUD operations. You should see the exact same behavior as with `@Resource`.

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, let's add a custom action that lists only the uncompleted todos:

[source,groovy]
----
def pending() {
    respond Todo.findAllByDone(false), view: 'index'
}
----

icon:hand-o-right[] And also a URL mapping for such action:

[source,groovy]
----
"/pendingTodos"(controller: 'todo', action: 'pending')
----

icon:hand-o-right[] If you run the application now, you should be able to test this new endpoint:

----
$ curl -i 0:8080/pendingTodos
----

icon:hand-o-right[] You can flag one todo as completed:

----
curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"done": true}' -X PUT 0:8080/todos/3
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, verify that the `/pendingTodos` endpoint works as expected.

=== Customising the JSON response with JSON views (15 minutes)

The https://github.com/grails/grails-views[Grails Views] project provides additional view technologies to the Grails
framework, including JSON and Markup views. It was introduced in Grails 3.0.

JSON views are written in Groovy, end with the file extension `gson` and reside in the `grails-app/views` directory.
They provide a DSL for producing output in the JSON format. A hello world example can be seen below:

[source,groovy]
.`grails-app/views/hello.gson`
----
json.message {
    hello "world"
}
----

The above JSON view results in the output:

[source,javascript]
----
{"message":{ "hello":"world"}}
----

The `json` variable is an instance of
http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/api/groovy/json/StreamingJsonBuilder.html[StreamingJsonBuilder]. See the
http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/documentation/core-domain-specific-languages.html#_streamingjsonbuilder[documentation]
in the Groovy user guide for more information on `StreamingJsonBuilder`.

icon:hand-o-right[] To get started with the JSON views for the `Todo` domain class, run the `generate-views` command:

----
$ grails generate-views todo.Todo
| Rendered template index.gson to destination grails-app/views/todo/index.gson
| Rendered template show.gson to destination grails-app/views/todo/show.gson
| Rendered template _domain.gson to destination grails-app/views/todo/_todo.gson
| Scaffolding completed for grails-app/domain/todo/Todo.groovy
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's change `grails-app/views/todo/_todo.gson` to put some https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08[HAL] information in the response:

[source,groovy]
----
import todo.Todo

model {
	Todo todo
}

json {
	_links {
		self {
			href "${g.link(resource: 'todo', absolute: true)}/${todo.id}"
		}
	}
  id todo.id
	description todo.description
	done todo.done
}
----

icon:hand-o-right[] If we run the application and hit the `/todos` endpoint, we can see the new information:

[source,javascript]
----
[{
	"id": 1,
	"description": "Todo 1",
	"done": false,
	"_links": {
		"self": {
			"href": "http://localhost:8080/todos/1"
		}
	}
}, {
  ...
}]
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Fortunately, Grails' JSON views comes with support for HAL automatically:

[source,groovy]
----
import todo.Todo

model {
	Todo todo
}

json {
	hal.links(todo)
	id todo.id
	description todo.description
	done todo.done
}
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Hit the `/todos` endpoint again to see the difference.

== Creating an AngularJS front-end (50 minutes)

TIP: Change to the `ex02` folder to start working on this exercise. The final solution is provided to you in the
`ex02/solution` folder.

=== The `angular` profile (10 minutes).

The `angular` profile was introduced in Grails 3.1. It provides a more focused set of dependencies and commands to work
with Angular JS. The `angular` profile inherits from the `rest-api` profile and therefore has all of the commands and
properties that the REST profile has.

The `angular` profile creates applications that provides the following features:

* Default set of commands for creating Angular artefacts.
* Gradle plugin to manage client side dependencies.
* Gradle plugin to execute client side unit tests.
* Asset Pipeline plugins to ease development.

By default the Angular profile includes GSP support in order to render the index page. This is necessary because the
profile is designed around http://www.asset-pipeline.com/[`asset-pipeline`].

The new commands that the profile brings are:

* `create-ng-component`.
* `create-ng-controller`.
* `create-ng-directive`.
* `create-ng-domain`.
* `create-ng-module`.
* `create-ng-service`.

All the files generated are placed by default under `grails-app/assets/javascripts`. For example, the command
`grails create-ng-controller foo` will create the file
`grails-app/assets/javascripts/${default package name}/controllers/fooController.js`.

For every artefact created, the profile commands will also create a skeleton unit test file under `src/test/javascripts`

icon:hand-o-right[] To get started with the Angular profile create an application with by specifying angular as the name
of the profile:

----
$ grails create-app --profile angular -features hibernate,json-views todo
| Application created at /tmp/todo
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, copy the following elements from the previous project to the created one:

* `grails-app/controllers/todo/TodoController.groovy`.
* `grails-app/domain/todo/Todo.groovy`.
* `grails-app/init/BootStrap.groovy`.
* `grails-app/views/todo/*`.

icon:hand-o-right[] After that, re-apply the URL mappings that we previously had:

[source,groovy]
----
"/todos"(resources:"todo")
"/pendingTodos"(controller: 'todo', action: 'pending')
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, run the application to ensure that the `/todo` and `/pendingTodos` are working as expected.
Also, if you load the root URL, you should see something like:

image::localhost.png[]

=== Writing the AngularJS code (40 minutes)

WARNING: Ultimately it's not a goal of this workshop that you become a master in Angular JS development. A basic Angular JS
knowledge is required to understand the steps performed through the exercise.

The entry point for the application, as specified by the `/` URL mapping, is `grails-app/views/index.gsp`. That file
contains by default information about the application. Simply ignore it.

icon:hand-o-right[] Find a `<section>` tag, and leave its body empty:

[source,html]
----
<div id="content" role="main">
    <section class="row colset-2-its">

        <!-- Our code will be here -->

    </section>
</div>
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Also, remove everything under `grails-app/assets/javascripts/*`, as we want to write our own code.

icon:hand-o-right[] Let's create a domain by running the following command:

----
$ grails create-ng-domain todo
| Rendered template NgModuleSpec.js to destination src/test/javascripts/todo/todo/todo.todoSpec.js
| Rendered template NgModule.js to destination grails-app/assets/javascripts/todo/todo/todo.todo.js
| Rendered template NgDomainSpec.js to destination src/test/javascripts/todo/domain/TodoSpec.js
| Rendered template NgDomain.js to destination grails-app/assets/javascripts/todo/domain/Todo.js
----

The `todo/domain/Todo.js` file will export a module that will allow us to write code such as `Todo.list()`,
`todo.save()`, etc. A-la-Grails! On such methods, Angular JS will transparently excute an HTTP request to the backend,
by taking into account the REST mappings. For example, `Todo.list()` will make an HTTP GET request, `todo.delete()`
will do a DELETE, etc.

icon:hand-o-right[] There's just a change we need to do on it: as our backend is at `/todos` and not `/todo`, find the
string `"todo/:id"` and replace it by `"todos/:id"`.

icon:hand-o-right[] The root module, generated at `grails-app/assets/javascripts/todo/todo.todo.js`, is named a bit
repetitive, so rename it to `app.js`, and leave it with the following content:

[source,javascript]
----
//= wrapped
//= require /angular/angular
//= require /angular/angular-resource
//= require_self
//= require_tree services
//= require_tree controllers
//= require_tree directives
//= require_tree domain
//= require_tree templates

angular.module("todo", ['ngResource']);
----

That will be our main file to be loaded in `index.gsp`. As you can see, it contains asset-pipeline instructions to
include other dependencies such as Angular itself, as well as our application code.

The dependencies like `angular` and `angular-resource` are fetched by the `bower-installer` Gradle plugin. You will
find a `bower { ... }` block in `build.gradle`. Those dependencies are gently handled by asset-pipeline, which takes
action during the build process, to bundle and minimise them into our `app.js` file. In development mode, however,
minimisation and bundling is not performed.

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, let's create a controller by running the following command:

----
$ grails create-ng-controller todo
| Warning Destination file src/test/javascripts/todo/todo/todo.todoSpec.js already exists, skipping...
| Rendered template NgModule.js to destination grails-app/assets/javascripts/todo/todo/todo.todo.js
| Rendered template NgControllerSpec.js to destination src/test/javascripts/todo/controllers/todoControllerSpec.js
| Rendered template NgController.js to destination grails-app/assets/javascripts/todo/controllers/todoController.js
----

icon:hand-o-right[] The controller code should look like this:

[source,javascript]
----
//= wrapped

angular
    .module("todo")
    .controller("TodoController", TodoController);

function TodoController(Todo) {
    var vm = this;

    vm.todos = Todo.list();

    vm.newTodo = new Todo();

    vm.save = function() {
        vm.newTodo.$save({}, function() {
            vm.todos.push(angular.copy(vm.newTodo));
            vm.newTodo = new Todo();
        });
    };

    vm.delete = function(todo) {
        todo.$delete({}, function() {
            var idx = vm.todos.indexOf(todo);
            vm.todos.splice(idx, 1);
        });
    };

    vm.update = function(todo) {
        todo.$update();
    };
}
----

Now, let's write the view code.

icon:hand-o-right[] First of all, make sure our entry point `app.js` is loaded in `index.gsp`. Find
the `<asset:javascript>` tag right before the closing `</body>`, and change it to point to our file:

[source,html]
----
<asset:javascript src="/todo/app.js" />
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Then, find the `<body>` tag and change it so it refers to our controller instead of the
default one that we deleted. It should look like:

[source,html]
----
<body ng-app="todo" ng-controller="TodoController as vm">
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Finally, inside the `<section>` tag, where we left a placeholder comment, write the following code:

[source,html]
----
<div class="form">
    <input type="text" ng-model="vm.newTodo.description" />
    <button type="button" ng-click="vm.save()">add</button>
</div>

<div ng-include="'/todo/list.html'"></div>
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, create the following file:

[source,html]
.`grails-app/assets/javascripts/todo/templates/list.tpl.html`
----
<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr ng-repeat="t in vm.todos">
            <td>
                {{t.description}}
            </td>
            <td>
                <input type="checkbox" ng-model="t.done" ng-click="vm.update(t)" />
            </td>
            <td>
                <button type="button" ng-click="vm.delete(t)">Delete</button>
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
----

And you are done! Go back to your browser and load http://localhost:8080[]:

image::todo.png[]

icon:hand-o-right[] With your browser's developer console open, try to create new todos, mark them as complete or
delete them, and you will see how Angular JS issues HTTP request to the backend we created in the first exercise.

== Adding security with Spring Security REST (50 minutes)

TIP: For this exercise, you can just continue working in the same project as the previous exercise. The final solution
is provided to you in the `ex03/solution` folder.

=== Introduction to Spring Security REST (10 minutes)

http://alvarosanchez.github.io/grails-spring-security-rest/[Spring Security REST] is a Grails plugin that allows you to
use Spring Security for a stateless, token-based, RESTful authentication.

The typical flow could be the following:

.Sequence diagram overview of the plugin behavior
image::http://alvarosanchez.github.io/grails-spring-security-rest/latest/docs/images/rest.png[]

. The client application requests and endpoint that requires authentication, so the server responds with a 401 response.
. The client redirects the user to the login form.
. The user enter credentials, and the client sends a request to the authentication endpoint. The server validates credentials, and if valid, generates, stores and sends back a token to the client.
. The client then stores the token internally. It will be sent on every API method request.
. The client sends again a request to the protected resource, passing the token as an HTTP header.
. The server validates the token, and if valid, executes the actual operation requested.

As per the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[REST definition], the client is transferring its
state on every request so the server is truly stateless.

The plugin helps you to wire your existing Spring Security authentication mechanism, provides you
with ready-to-use token generation strategies and comes prepackaged with JWT, Memcached, GORM, Redis
and Grails Cache support for token storage.

In this exercise we will use JWT. JSON Web Token (JWT) is an http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-json-web-token[IETF standard] (in progress)
which defines a secure way to encapsulate arbitrary data that can be sent over unsecure URL's.

Generally speaking, JWT's can be useful in the following use cases:

* When generating "one click" action emails, like "delete this comment" or "add this to favorites". Instead of giving
  the users URL's like `/comment/delete/123`, you can give them something like `/comment/delete/<JWT_TOKEN>`, where the
  `JWT_TOKEN` contains encapsulated information about the user and the comment, in a safe way, so authentication is not required.

* To achieve single sign-on, by sharing a JWT across applications.

In the context of authentication and authorization, JWT will help you implement a stateless implementation, as the
principal information is stored directly in the JWT.

This is how a JWT looks like:

image::http://alvarosanchez.github.io/grails-spring-security-rest/latest/docs/images/jwt.png[]

===== Header

A base64-encoded JSON like:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
}
----

===== Claims

A base64-encoded JSON like:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "exp": 1422990129,
    "sub": "jimi",
    "roles": [
        "ROLE_ADMIN",
        "ROLE_USER"
    ],
    "iat": 1422986529
}
----

===== Signature

Depends on the algorithm specified on the header, it can be a digital signature of the base64-encoded header and claims,
or an encryption of them using RSA.

=== Securing the REST API (20 minutes)

icon:hand-o-right[] To install the plugin, add this to your `dependencies { ... }` block in `build.gradle`:

[source,groovy]
----
compile "org.grails.plugins:spring-security-rest:2.0.0.M2"
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Run `grails compile` to resolve dependencies and ensure everything is correct. If necessary,
refresh also the project in your IDE (ie: refresh Gradle project in Intellij IDEA). Then, we need to generate our User,
Role and UserRole domain classes:

----
$ grails s2-quickstart todo User Role
| Creating User class 'User' and Role class 'Role' in package 'todo'
| Rendered template Person.groovy.template to destination grails-app/domain/todo/User.groovy
| Rendered template Authority.groovy.template to destination grails-app/domain/todo/Role.groovy
| Rendered template PersonAuthority.groovy.template to destination grails-app/domain/todo/UserRole.groovy
|
************************************************************
* Created security-related domain classes. Your            *
* grails-app/conf/application.groovy has been updated with *
* the class names of the configured domain classes;        *
* please verify that the values are correct.               *
************************************************************
----

icon:hand-o-right[] The above command will create the file `grails-app/conf/application.groovy`. In order to secure our
API, we need to replace the chain with pattern `/**` with this one:

[source,groovy]
----
[pattern: '/api/**',         filters: 'JOINED_FILTERS,-anonymousAuthenticationFilter,-exceptionTranslationFilter,-authenticationProcessingFilter,-securityContextPersistenceFilter,-rememberMeAuthenticationFilter']
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Notice that we are appling a stateless chain to the pattern `/api/**`, so we need to reflect this
change in a number of places:

* In the URL mappings file.
* In the `Todo.js` Angular domain.

icon:hand-o-right[] Now, add some data in `BootStrap.groovy`:

[source,groovy]
----
Role admin = new Role("ROLE_ADMIN").save()
User user = new User("user", "pass").save()
UserRole.create(user, admin, true)
----

icon:hand-o-right[] Finally, let's restrict our API to be accessed only for `ROLE_ADMIN` users:

[source,groovy]
.`TodoController.groovy`
----
package todo

import grails.plugin.springsecurity.annotation.Secured
import grails.rest.RestfulController

@Secured(['ROLE_ADMIN'])
class TodoController extends RestfulController {

...

}
----

icon:hand-o-right[] If you run the application now and try to access the endpoint with `curl`, you'll receive an error:

[source,javascript]
----
$ curl -i 0:8080/api/todos
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Wed, 01 Jun 2016 03:59:56 GMT

{"timestamp":1464753596208,"status":401,"error":"Unauthorized","message":"No message available","path":"/api/todos"}
----

As we saw in the introduction, we need to obtain a token first, and then pass it to the endpoint.

icon:hand-o-right[] To get a token, make a request to the login endpoint provided by the plugin:

[source,javascript]
----
$ curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{"username":"user","password":"pass"}' 0:8080/api/login
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
